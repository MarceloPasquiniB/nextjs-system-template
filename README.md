# WEB APPLICATION TEMPLATE

## 📚 About

This project consists of a web application template. The homepage contains a user registration and validation field, linked to Google FireBase as well as an image that changes with each access. The user can also sign in via a Google account, where a new window will open for validation via FireBase. 

When accessing the system, the template contains 1) a light and dark theme; 2) a generic avatar that is replaced by the photo registered on Google; 3) three customizable tabs for implementing functions.

Every time the user accesses the system, a Cookie is used to remember the login, as well as to persist their theme preference in local storage.

## 🚫 System validations

As validation, if the user tries to access the system without a valid registration, an error message is displayed for 5 seconds on the screen. The same happens if the credentials entered are wrong.

For security reasons, the routes of each tab of the system have their rendering conditioned to the authentication Cookie.
